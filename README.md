# Spongy Bubbles Particles App MOO ICT

In this tutorial we will make a bubbles particle system using windows form, paint and visual studio. I always had a obsession with windows form because you can do a lot of the cool stuff with this that gets over looked because it there are other platforms that do it better. However I found that by doing a lot of the crazy experiments with windows you can always learn C# in a more practical and deep way. Its very subtle to what we can do with windows form and  in this tutorial I will show you how to make a useless bubbles particle system using paint events in windows form application with visual studio. Please let me know what you think of the videos and the series. 

Nice particle systems can be created inside of visual studio and you can get very nice end result from all of this too. I will continue to make some of the fun tutorials for windows form and C#.
